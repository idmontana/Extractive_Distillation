# Extractive_Distillation
The optimal design of an extractive distillation column is approached in this study considering both continuous and discrete design variables. First, it was modeled by the general formulation of a MINLP problem using binary decision variables. Next, three reformulations of the problem were carried out, expressing the binary variables as a function of external variables. Later, the problem was solved using the D-SDA algorithm, which allows the problem to be separated into a master-IPLC that varies the discrete variables, and an FNLP subproblem that optimizes the continuous variables in each discrete step. Finally, the performance of the different possible neighborhoods for the master-IPLC and of the reformulations proposed was evaluated, as well as the efficiency of this method in comparison with other resolution methods, both NLP and MINLP.
